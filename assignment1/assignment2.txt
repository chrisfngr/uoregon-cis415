Assignment 2

1.
a) I would create one thread for input and output, because the bottle neck is the disk, so it doesn't make sense 
to use more than one thread, since it won't go any faster, since the thread still has to wait on the I/O.

b) I would create 4 threads for the CPU-intensive portion. Since this is all computation, it makes sense to
utilize every core, but not to use more threads than cores available, because that doesn't give you access to
anymore computing power, and just adds overhead.

3.
This short-term scheduling algorithm will favor I/O because since I/O is generally very slow compared to other
operations, it will have spent the recent past getting data or placing data, which doesn't use the CPU. However,
CPU-bound programs won't be starved because I/O is slow enough, that it isn't always happening, so there will be
times when there's nothing for the processor to do, so it will schedule the CPU-bound programs.

4.
a)
Optimizing CPU utilization could mean continuing to compute rather than sending an output to I/O until there's
other work for the CPU to do, which then increases response time.
b)
Average turnaround time and maximum waiting time.
Average turnaround time is optimized by trying to finish tasks as soon as possible, which can be in direct
conflict with a technique in minimizing waiting time by breaking up longer jobs to make sure shorter ones
always are getting finished.
c)
I/O Device utilization can mean there's nothing in the ready queue for the CPU because processes are all in the
waiting queue, pending on the return of data from I/O, thereby leaving the CPU with nothing to do and unoptimize
CPU utilization.
