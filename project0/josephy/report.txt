My project will compile with a few errors, but it doesn't work properly.
Mentry works without memory leaks or errors, but MList does not work.
Its resize and destroy functions were not implemented properly.

Because S.txt doesn't need to resize, it will work with my full solution, although there are still memory leaks.
